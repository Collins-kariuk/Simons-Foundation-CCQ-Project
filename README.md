# Generating Analytical Tight-Binding Expressions from First-Principle Calculations
This repository holds most of what I did as part of my summer 2023 project at the Flatiron Institute Center for Computational Quantum Physics (CCQ). This mainly entails the investigation of the tight binding model on various toy models, and more importantly transition metal compounds.
